# Vapor-Template
A starting point for all of my Vapor projects

You are welcome to use this for your projects as well. It is already setup for MySQL use, and comes with `User` and `Session` classes preinstalled. You can modify it to how you deem fit, but I've found that this setup works really well for me.

# Deployment
You can deploy this template to Heroku really easily (either use the CLI or the online GUI). It's already setup to work with JawsDB MySQL.

# Vapor Usage
To clone this template to a new Vapor project, do this: `vapor new project_name --template=mcdappdev/Vapor-Template`
